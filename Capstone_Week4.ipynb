    "When people travel to or visit new places, they would want to live in places that are similar to the places they were used to. There are many neighborhoods arount the New York City. When residents of New York city visit Toronto, it would be helpful for them to get a good understanding of the new city if they know what neighbothoods of Toronto are similar to what neighborhoods of New York. On the other hand, if residents of Toronto visit New York City the first time, they would also like to know which parts of New York are similar compared to the parts of Toronto. Thus, in this project, the problem of similarity of the neighborhoods of the two cities will be solved. This is done by exploring and analyzing the venues near New York and Toronto neighborhoods. Neighborhoods with similar venues will be clustered together."
